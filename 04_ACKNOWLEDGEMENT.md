# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

---

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of this Major Project titled **"Python Pocket IDE: Advanced Mobile Integrated Development Environment for Python Programming"**.

First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt thanks to **[Faculty Supervisor Name]**, my project supervisor, for their invaluable guidance, continuous support, and constructive feedback throughout the project development. Their expertise and mentorship have been instrumental in shaping this project.

I am deeply grateful to **Chandigarh University** and the **Centre for Distance & Online Education** for providing me with the opportunity to pursue this major project as part of my Master of Computer Applications programme. The university's resources and academic environment have been crucial for my learning and development.

I would like to acknowledge the **MCA Jul 2023 batch community**, particularly the members of the "ONLINE MCA-CU Un-Official" group, whose discussions and feedback helped me understand the real-world needs that this project addresses. Their insights into Python learning challenges and mobile development requirements were invaluable.

Special recognition goes to **PsiCodes** and the original **KtxPy project contributors** for creating the foundational codebase upon which this enhanced Python Pocket IDE is built. Their open-source contribution has been essential to this project's development.

I acknowledge the developers of the following technologies and tools that made this project possible:
- **Sora Editor** team for the code editor framework
- **Google** for Android development tools and Jetpack Compose
- **Python Software Foundation** for Python 3.11.5 runtime
- **Termux** team for Android-based Python environment insights
- **Material Design** team for UI/UX guidelines

I am thankful to my family and friends for their constant encouragement and support throughout my academic journey and project development.

Finally, I appreciate all the faculty members of the Computer Science and Engineering department who have contributed to my learning experience and provided guidance during various phases of this project.

This project would not have been possible without the collective support and contributions of all the above-mentioned individuals and organizations.
